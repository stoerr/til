# TIL (Things / Today I've learned)

A collection of small things that don't warrant a full [blog post](http://hans-peter-stoerr.de/blog.html). This is a
combination of a kind of micro blog and a personal knowledge database. It's available as a website at 
[https://til.stoerr.net/](https://til.stoerr.net/), the source is on [Github](https://github.com/stoerr/til) .

I got that idea from Simon Willisons impressive [TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/) which goes back to [this](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9).
