# TIL

Things I've learned. This is intended to be a personal knowledge database with random more or less sorted knowledge
snippets, probably to be used with ChatGPT somehow, but it's public, so you can use that if it's valuable to you.

Work in progress - this is intended to be something like https://github.com/simonw/til but I'll see when I'll get around
to that.
